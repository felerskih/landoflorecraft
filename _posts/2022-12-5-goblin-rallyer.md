Are you looking for a solution to add a slight difficulty bump to your fights to challenge your min-maxers? Or are you looking for a party mascot that does more than whittle the enemy down slowly and take up the Cleric’s spell slots? The Goblin Rallyer is a good choice for both. This monster started as a challenge to design a non-spellcasting support monster without ripping off the inspiration mechanic and a gift to my players after solving some tricky puzzles. As an enemy though, it can increase a monster's difficulty while being an easy target to kill. It can even be useful to high level monsters who keep the Goblin Rallyer around against the creature's will – though they need to be protective of their squishy buddy.


Sorovian Lore: Groblin the Goblin, fanatic of the party and one time barkeep was a Goblin Rallyer. Conscripted to the Hobgoblin army, he was freed by the party after they defeated his commanding officer.
